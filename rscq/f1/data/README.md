# Data
This folder consists of data that the program used to generate graphs such as bar and line plots. They are in CSV (comma-delimited) format created using Excel.
  
*Note: not all of the files are used, the were from previous drafts of the document. Additionally, when you navigate to the website at shaunakgadkarigwsc.github.io/rscq/f1/, you are not seeing the graphs generated in real time off this data, they are simply exported off of my computer. So this folder could be deleted and the website would look the same.*
